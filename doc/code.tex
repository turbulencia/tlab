\chapter{Code}\label{sec:code}

The root directory contains the sources for the common libraries, and the directory {\tt tools} contains the sources for the specific binaries: the main code in {\tt tools/dns}, and the preprocessing and postprocessing tools.

Files {\tt README} and {\tt TODO} contain additional information. To compile, read {\tt INSTALL}.

Directory {\tt examples} contains a few examples to get acquainted with using the code.

\section{Input file dns.ini}

The following tables describe the different blocks appearing in the input file {\tt dns.ini}. The first column contains the tag. The second column contains the possible values, the first one being the default one and the word {\it value} indicating that a numerical value needs to be provided. The third column describes the field. This data is read in the file {\tt *\_READ\_GLOBAL} and in the files {\tt *\_READ\_LOCAL} of each of the tools.

Data is case insensitive.
